Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- :star: Magic :star:

## Features
- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) writes on the [Markdown site](site_url)  

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

- [markdown-it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown-it) - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Bootstrap) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/node.js) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
